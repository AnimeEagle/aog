- Changed "Update persona" script to easily change armors, accesories and helmets. In this way you can easily add new armors or accesories/helmets to the Avatar
(See instructions)

####################################################################
Instructions of how to add a new armor/accesory/helmet to the avatar.
####################################################################

The update persona script I have created has the following structure:

Picture 2 is used to show nude garnet (either normal, normal with slave collar, normal with handcuffs, and normal with handcuffs and slave collar)
Picture 3 Is used to show armor (cotton robe, latex outfit, etc)
Picture 4 is used to show accesories
Picture 5 is used to show helmets

Picture 3 will show up "in front" of picture 2. Picture 4 will display "in front of" picture 3, and so on, So the base
picture will be always Garnet nude, adding layers of pictures depicting armor, accesories, etc

The structure of the event is like this:

- Delete all pictures to clean all stuff
-If Garnet is a slave
	-If Garnet is handcuffed
		-show base picture of garnet nude and handcuffed (with collar)
		-go to ARMORS (handcuffed)
	-else
		-show base picture of garnet nude (with collar)
		-go to ARMORS

		ARMORS (HANDCUFFED)
		-Go to armor1
		-if equiped armor1 
			(show pic of armor1 handcuffed)
		-else go to armor2

		-if equiped armor2 
			(show pic of armor2 handcuffed)
		-else go to armor3
		.
		.
		.
		-if equiped armor_n 
			(show pic of armor_n handcuffed)               <---armor n is the last one
		-else go to ACCESORIES (HANDCUFFED)

		ACCESORIES (HANDCUFFED)
		-Go to accesory1
		-if equiped accesory1 
			(show pic of accesory1 handcuffed)
		-else go to accesory2

		-if equiped accesory2 
			(show pic of accesory2 handcuffed)
		-else go to accesory3
		.
		.
		.
		-if equiped accesory_n 
			(show pic of accesory_n handcuffed)               <---accesory n is the last one
		-else go to HELMETS (HANDCUFFED)

		HELMETS (HANDCUFFED)
		-Go to helmet1
		-if equiped helmet1 
			(show pic of helmet1 handcuffed)
		-else go to helmet2

		-if equiped helmet2 
			(show pic of helmet2 handcuffed)
		-else go to helmet3
		.
		.
		.
		-if equiped helmet_n 
			(show pic of helmet_n handcuffed)               <---helmet n is the last one
		-else END
else
	go to check if Garnet is normal


-If Garnet is Normal
		-if ()
			RUN ALL THE STUFF ABOVE BUT WITHOUT SLAVE COLLAR PICTURE
		-else END
-else
	go to check if garnet is a dog

-If Garnet is a dog
	run the dog event's stuff
-else
	END


Basically, what you need to do in order to add a new armor/accesory/helmet to the game
is:
1.- Create the item
2.- Create 2 images of the item, one used for handcuffed Garnet and other for normal (this is specially important
    if creating an armor). You may use the same picture if creating an accesory or a helmet. Depends of the image
    you create
3.- Replace the last lines of all branches (Garnet slave (handcuffed and not), Garnet Normal(handcuffed and not) of the
    items:
	If adding a new armor, change it like this:

		-if equiped armor2 
			(show pic of armor2 handcuffed)
		-else go to armor3
		.
		.
		.
		-if equiped armor_n 
			(show pic of armor_n handcuffed)               <---armor n is the last one
		-else go to ACCESORIES (HANDCUFFED)

                 ################################
                 
		-if equiped armor2 
			(show pic of armor2 handcuffed)
		-else go to armor3
		.
		.
		.
		-if equiped armor_n 
			(show pic of armor_n handcuffed)               <---armor n WAS the last one, NOW YOURS IS THE LAST ONE
		-else go to YOUR ARMOR (HANDCUFFED)
		
		-if equiped YOUR ARMOR
			(SHOW PIC OF YOUR ARMOR)
		else go to ACCESORIES (HANDCUFFED)

And that's it
#######################################################################################################################################


- Added some pictures to graphics directory:

For armors: 	cotton robe, cotton robe when handcuff
		latex outfit, latex outfit when handcuff
		bunny suit, bunny suit when handcuff
		apron, apron when handcuff

For accesories: Dog accesories, dog accesories when handcuff
		necklace
		slave collar 
		blindfold
		gagball
		gagball updated
		blindfold + gagball


- Added 2 armors (accesories) on the database:
		042:ballgag updated
		043: blindfold + ballgag
- Added state 027: "Clumsy and Gagged" for the blindfold + ballgag item 


- Modified the Kristal normal stand picture and Kristal handcuffed stand so accesories and helmets can match the sprites

- Modified the Garnet the dog Character so she has fixed dog collar and dog accesories equiped
		
- Added Variable 201: Dog autocollar.
	Used to set an event with Cerberus if you decide to equip the dog collar (After he has already turn you back to normal and you possess the collar). He will assume he has already helped you, but you equiped the collar
again. So he tells you he can help you again for some stuff. This is so Garnet can use the collar for some events (maybe when needs unnoticed access for some areas).
Of course the Cerberus Event should be copied on all towns so garnet can turn to normal.

- Added Variable 202: Dog trained. 
	Used to set a different dialogue if you find the mistress after she has trained garnet. (It could occur that you turn into a dog via the dog house and Mistress
	does not know Garnet At all

- Added event pages for dog's Mistress that will show different dialogues

Changes in DOG EVENTS:

-CHanged Dali's Soldiers dog event: If Garnet is a Dog, the dialogue changes




-Added event page for the soldiers on the Dali's Bar: If Garnet is a Dog, the dialogue changes
-Added event for Pimp on Dali's Bar:If Garnet is a Dog, the dialogue changes
- Reviewed all normal character events, so if Garnet is a Dog, they have propper dialogue

Fixed bugged gameover event in goblin caves,  slaves and dogs no longer immortal.


Pimp no longer gives free money

Fixed whips,  now properly equipable by Slaves, weaker than swords and undead are resistant,  but its better than nothing, and the whips add status effects.

Modded Check hypnosis common event,  it now ensures all garnets share the same hypnosis/curse status as the current active garnet.

Modded Check for Orgasm Common event,  Now much more dramatic max SP gains and HP losses,  applied an INT gain upon climax and applied the stat changes to all 3 garnets

Modified "Sleep in bed" common event, now works differently when cursed

Library H-event started but not completed

Quadrupled the SP gain from Dog events for balance purposes

Altered the Debug Common event to increase/decrease SP in addition to perversion


To use spells.
1) talk to the Librarian to start the library book quest

2) Retrieve all 18 books either by searching town, or by using the temporary debug 
events in the library

3) Talk to the Librian with all 18 overdue books, and she'll let you check out spellbooks, you start only able to check out one book at a time, but this number can 
easily be increased by quests, there is a debug event in the library that sets your max spellbooks to 2

4) Use the spellbook in your inventory,  You'll learn between 0 and 3 spells right now depending on your class and level,  Currently Adventurer Can learn from all 3, Slave garnet from 2 books and Dog garnet only from one.

5) Go to the Hotkeys menu, hit up and down to select a hotkey slot and hit confirm, then pick a spell to go in that hotkey

6) Leave the menus, then hit the number corresponding to the hotkey slot you want to use (aka "1" for the first hotkey "2" for the second etc)

7) get in range of an enemy and hit the "C" key to cast a spell

8) The spells are strong, but SP is limited, and only refills from H-events or Items

9) To change your spells talk to the librarian and return the books, you'll forget your old spells and get the book containing your new ones.

    Added script perversion to track SP and change V49 appropriately (percentage/10). V49 should from now on only be seen as read-only, and SP is instead used to change perversion. Changes to v49 will become undone at a SP change.
    Binding perversion to SP was the original intent (I gather) and can be quite fun. maybe you should be able to "channel" your perversion :D
    
    Script
      Perversion
        Hijacked Game_Battler's sp= call to see if Actor 1's (Garnets) SP was changed, and if so change V49 to one tenth of the percentage (valid range 0-10).
    Map008
      Removed SP change from dog house. (How come it changes HP +9999 when the Inn only gives you HP+200?)

    Added a simple time tracker with dawn, day, dusk and night screen effect, and a switch (111) to check if it's night for event special functions. This is a system that runs constantly so it may not be the best solution if you want VH like map changes as the time of day changes, unless it may be eased in one way or another (possible variable/switch for tracking dusk/dawn, with events like "merchant leaves map").
    Switches:
    110 (Track time) - Should time be tracked? Required for Time Tracker (031). Used in situation where you don't want the screen color modified.

    Outlined animation for Carthage East Alley & Dungeon events. Minor change in dialog for Adventurer in Carthage East.
    Almost messed this one up due to an incorrect checkout :O remember to make a local branch when getting something from the remote!

    Adventurer - Choice gone from "I like him" to "He's cute"
    
    Map077 (dungeon):
    Global Event - set default looping animation.
    Global Event - set adventurer costume change and minor movement.
    Global Event - animated the "family reunion" part.
    Global Event - upped the wait time
    Global Event - added a more progressive fatigue for branch B. Still needs more work.
    
    Map078 (alley):
    Global Event - Outlined the animation for the main part of the event.
    Global Event - Now transfers the player to the Carthage Main Street when finished
    Global Event - added day/night/morning lighting cycle
    Global Event - Adventurer now leaves as the main event begins
