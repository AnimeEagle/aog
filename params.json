Run Game.bat to convert the source files to the required format.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nNavigation : Arrow-keys, WASD-keys\r\n\r\nConfirm/Action/Attack : Z, Enter, K\r\n\r\nCancel/Abort : X, F, End, Esc\r\n\r\nSettings : F1\r\n\r\nFull-screen/windowed : Alt+Enter\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting Involved\r\n\r\nWe welcome criticism, suggestions and further involvement.\r\n\r\nVisit our project wiki at https://github.com/gegerlan/aog/wiki to get more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known Issues and Workarounds\r\n\r\n### Game crashes at start with: 'Failed to load script' error.\r\n\r\nRun the Game.bat file. A small command window should appear and go through the source files, making them playable. \r\n\r\n### Editor crashes at start with: 'Failed to load actor data.'\r\n\r\nRun the Editor.bat file.\r\n\r\n### Game.bat won't work, it just disappears and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nIf you get an error message that \"'rxdatav.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command...\", a required file is missing or corrupted.\r\n\r\nFirst make sure that the file rxdatav.exe can be found in the Utility folder.\r\n\r\nIf the required file can be found in the Utility folder, there may be an issue with another application interfering with the executable. Try replacing the Utility folder with the old rxdatav (utility_old.zip), that can be downloaded from the projects [Downloads section](https://github.com/gegerlan/aog/downloads).\r\n\r\n### FATAL ERROR: Failed to open executable\r\n\r\nThe location of the game is currently causing issues. Try moving it to another folder (e.g. directly to C).\r\n\r\n### Changing equipment may not update the list correctly\r\n\r\nLeave and return to the equipment view.\r\n\r\n### The Dali baths are empty\r\n\r\nThis probably means that you've used the old SVN respository address for the game.
